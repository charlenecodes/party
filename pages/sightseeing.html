                Switzerland is a country full of mountains and lakes. There is endless nature to explore, as well as well-preserved Medieval cities. Here you can experience city and nature all in one.</div>
                <br>
            <div class="container d-flex justify-content-center text-center">
                Switzerland has 4 national languages, which include German, French, Italian, and Romansh. Most of Switzerland speaks German and Swiss German, but there are regions that speak Italian. Switzerland is divided into Cantons, which is the equivalent of states in America. Here are some of our favorite destinations (along with tips for the Crash Landing on You fans lol).</div>
                <br>
            <p class="heading">Canton of Bern
                <ul>
                    <li>Old town Bern</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Einstein</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Einstein used to study, live, and work in Switzerland. Here you will find multiple statues of Einstein sitting on a bench or you can visit his old house, which has been turned into a museum.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Rosengarten Bern</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The best view of the old town and the Aare River can be seen here. You can either hike up the steep hill or ride the bus.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Bärengraben</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Just at the very front of the old town, you will notice that there are European bears on the side of the hill with the view of the river. To find this easily, you can either search Bärengraben on Google Maps or search Altes Tramdepot, where you can also get a nice view of the city, especially during sunset.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Bundeshaus (Parliament Building)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This would be equivalent to the White House in the US. You can enter the gates behind the Bundeshaus and you can see many people hanging out there, where you can get a different view of town. You can also go down to the Aare river behind the Bundeshaus. It is a good place to check out at night, when it is all lit up.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
